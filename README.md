![Improve location accuracy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtgrosser/DenyLocationConsent/master/gfx/location_accuracy.png)

Disable the annoying "Improve location accuracy?" dialog and always disagree.

Based on [Xposed-Disable-Location-Consent](https://github.com/MohammadAG/Xposed-Disable-Location-Consent), but doing the opposite.
