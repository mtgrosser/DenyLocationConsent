![Improve location accuracy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtgrosser/DenyLocationConsent/master/gfx/location_accuracy.png)

Disable the annoying "Improve location accuracy?" dialog and always disagree.

Based on [Xposed-Disable-Location-Consent](https://github.com/MohammadAG/Xposed-Disable-Location-Consent), but doing the opposite.

Use the following versions depending on your version of Play Services:

| Play Services Version  | DenyLocationConsent Version |

| 8.x                    | 0.3                         |
| 9.x                    | 0.4                         |
| >= 12.5.21             | 0.5                         |
